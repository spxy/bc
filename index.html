<p>
Welcome to the first edition of our online reading session. This is a
tiny book club. In the first edition, we will be diving into the
beautiful world of <em>number theory</em>.

  The Matrix room and Freenode channel are bridged together, so if you
  join one of them, you will automatically receive the updates and
  messages from the other one too. If you are not an active Freenode
  user, prefer joining the Matrix room because it is more convenient,
  e.g., you can close your browser or client and your chat session will
  still stay alive. You can connect back the next day and catch up with
  the messages. Doing that with Freenode IRC requires slightly more work
  (setting up IRC bouncers etc.).

<h2 id="reference">Reference Material<a href="#reference"></a></h2>

<p>
The primary reference book for these meetings is going to be:
<em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em> written by Tom M.
Apostol. Admittedly, the book is quite expensive but you may find a
relatively cheap paperback (softcover) copy on some websites. A DRM-free
PDF eBook is available for purchase at <a
href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633">springer.com/gp/book/9780387901633</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are unable to buy the reference book, you can still participate
in this book club activity by downloading freely available notes from
  the University of Illinois: <a
href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/ant/main.pdf">main.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
For solutions to exercise problems, refer to this excellent PDF created
by Greg Hurst: <a

    <h3>
      Who are you?
      <a href="#faq-who"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi! I am <a href="https://susam.in/">Susam</a>. I am just someone
      who enjoys mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs and wants to spread the
      joy of spending time with these beautiful things. I have been
      working as an information security professional for about 15
      years. Of these 15 years, close to 7 years were spent working with
      probability theory, calculus, and combinatorics, and another 3
      years in implementation of cryptographic utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do a lot of teaching as hobby. This is my way of giving
      something back to the technology community. I have taught Common
      Lisp, Emacs, Python, C, Vim, and various areas of mathematics. In
      each one of my previous workplaces, I have created communities
      around mathematics, algorithms, and/or, cryptography. In the
      online world, I created the <a
      href="https://webchat.freenode.net/##algorithms">##algorithms</a>
      channel on Freenode IRC (my nick there is <code>spal</code>). What
      started as a tiny hobby club around algorithms 13 years ago is now
      a thriving community with over 200 members. (Disclosure: I don't
      participate in it anymore but a highly talented group of
      moderators helps maintain the channel).
    </p>
    <p>
      These hobbies of teaching and forming local and online communities
      have also led me to write some open source projects. Some are
      mildly popular and some not so popular but have managed to find
      its own niche community of users. For example, <a
      href="https://github.com/susam/texme">TeXMe</a> and <a
      href="http://mathb.in/">MathB.in</a> were born out of the need to
      share mathematics problems and solutions within these communities.
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/uncap">Uncap</a> was born when I
      used to teach Vim and I wanted Windows users to have a good
      ergonomic experience. Similarly, <a
      href="https://github.com/susam/emacs4cl">Emacs4CL</a> was born
      while teaching Common Lisp with Emacs and SLIME.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize, I work in information security by profession and I
      am an open source software developer by hobby. I want to use some
      part of my leisure time in hosting book club meetings where we
      pick up good books and work through them together.
    </p>

  <li id="faq-why">
    <h3>
      Why are you doing this?
      <a href="#faq-why"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      During the course of my career and hobbies, I have found
      Mathematics, Lisp, and Emacs to be extraordinarily elegant and
      beautiful and it is my goal to introduce as many people to these
      things as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Software development these days focus a lot around stitching
      together many libraries to accomplish complex tasks. I understand
      that this is more economical and productive. This approach has
      certainly made it possible to develop huge and complex
      software-based infrastructure that has changed the way we live.
      However, I think, in this fast-paced software development world,
      the simpler joys of devising or implementing algorithms from
      scratch and appreciating the underlying beauty of mathematics is
      taking a backseat. I intend to introduce more and more people to
      some of these simpler joys, especially, the joy of unravelling the
      mysteries of prime numbers, appreciating the simplicity and
      elegance of Lisp, experiencing the remarkable extensibility of
      Emacs, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the more I help others work though a formidable book like
      <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>, the more it helps
      me too to appreciate some finer and deeper points that I may not
      have paid due attention to when I read the book for the first
      time. So I benefit from these reading sessions too. Similarly, the
      more I help someone with Common Lisp programming, the more I have
      to dive into the Common Lisp HyperSpec which often teaches me a
      few new things too, so I gain from the experience too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-book">
    <h3>
      Have you read the entire book?
      <a href="#faq-book"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      No, I have read approximately half of the book (Introduction to
      Analytic Number Theory) and I am enjoying it so far. This means
      that I am a good number of chapters ahead of someone who has just
      begun reading this book, so I can maintain a steady pace in the
      reading sessions and also be able to tell if some topics or areas
      of confusion in an earlier chapter will be clarified in a later
      chapter.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-lisp">
    <h3>
      You mentioned Lisp. Can you do a book club for it?
      <a href="#faq-lisp"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Lisp and Emacs are two other areas at the top of my mind.
      Once there has been sufficient progress in the number theory book
      club, I plan to start a Lisp one next. Join the <a
      href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">Matrix
      room</a> or <a
      href="https://app.element.io/#/room/#susam:matrix.org">follow me
      on Twitter</a> to receive further updates about this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-but">
    <h3>
      But I want to do group reading sessions for another book!
      <a href="#faq-but"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Start your own book club around it! This is mine. I have chosen
      number theory as the topic of discussion for now. After a few
      months, I will move on to topics around Lisp and Emacs. If you
      have a different topic or book in mind, start your own book club
      for it. You can reuse my channels (see top of this page) for it or
      you can do it your own way. If you let me know about it and if I
      can find the time, I will join your book club too! I think, we
      need more book clubs, not less!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      Will these sessions be recorded?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Not at this time because we often refer to a few pages of the book
      via screen sharing during the reading session. I don't know the
      copyright implications of recording such sessions as videos and
      sharing them with everyone online. If you have expertise in this
      area, I would like to know if my concern is genuine and if there
      is a way to resolve it.
